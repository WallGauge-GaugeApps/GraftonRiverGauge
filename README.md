# Grafton River Gauge

The Grafton Illinois WallGauge shows the current gauge height (river level), 24 hour forecast, and 14 day forecast at the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. The large main gauge depicts the current river level.  You can see the various flood stages and how the high water can affect Grafton residents and businesses.  The data for the WallGauge is from a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gauge located on the east side of town. The data from this gauge is shared with USGS and NOAA.  Those two organizations use the gauge data to create river forecast and make that data available to the public.

## Grafton, Il

Grafton is one of a few remaining “authentic river towns” located on the scenic Great River Road (Rt 100) right at the confluence of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers.  The little river town embraces the river and has not built a levee walling off the river as most river towns have.  The river front is dotted with small art shops, restaurants, a marina, a ski lift up into the bluffs, and several bed and breakfast. The lack of a levee keeps the town fluid as it tends to get a major flood about every 5 to 10 years.  The floods can be catastrophic to the town’s people and local businesses. Somehow the little river town always reemerges a little better than before with a mixture of new and old business.  It is as if the river comes along every 10 years and flushes out the week leaving the true river lovers (river rats).
